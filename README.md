 The project we are presenting is a portfolio website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive user experience. The site is responsive, making it accessible on various platforms, and features interesting resources such as parallax scrolling, anchor navigation, pulling files via AJAX, and animated graphics.
